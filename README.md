# Text-Fabrication
This repository is about the Data Fabrication Technique to generate a variations in character numbers and symbols are necessary. For this, a blank image is used as the canvas, and the text fonts are loaded. Random characters are generated from these loaded fonts in the batch code format. By randomly arranging the batch code positions from horizontal and vertical and applying random rotation angles, this technique generates a high degree of randomization. As a result, a variety of data are used to make the both text detection and recognition model more generalized and robust.
